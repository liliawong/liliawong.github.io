                    <p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
                    <br><font size=3>Camellia Rd Tea Bar is a boba shop located in the Kearny Mesa Convoy District in San Diego, CA. Their business goal revolves around creating wholesome boba milk teas through their use of natural and high quality ingredients. The owners, Ricky and Dylan, strive to build a friendly community with their customers. They spent a lot of time designing their original website, but since they are not professionals with web development and design, they used a template, which limited their choices in implementing the site. The mobile experience was not ideal as they wanted and it had a few bugs. Overall, they wanted their website to <b>look and feel</b> like walking into the store itself.</br>
                        <br><b>PROJECT</b> - redesign Camellia Rd's website to improve brand projection, content, site architecture, navigation, and design
                        <br><b>DATE</b> - jan 2018 - march 2018
                        <br><b>MY ROLE</b> - ux + ui designer
                        <br><b>SKILLS</b> - ux design, interviewing, creative brief, competitive analysis, moodboard, prototyping, web design
                        <br><b>TOOLS</b> - balsamiq, InVision, github
                        <br><b>TEAM</b> - team of 4

                    <p><b>DESIGN PROCESS</font></b></p>
                    <br><font size=4><b>Getting to Know the Client</b></font>
                    <br><font size=3>Our team interviewed Ricky, who is the store manager of Camellia Rd. He described the goal of the business as <b>community oriented</b>. Even though the shop is situated in a business-centered environment, his hope is to bring a community together and promote the idea of “wholesomeness”, that is to promote “good for the body, mind, and soul.” Much of their inspiration comes from other boba shops such as 7 Leaves Cafe and Boba Guys, companies who both emphasize the use of natural ingredients rather than powders. Camellia Rd’s brand can be summed up with the vibe of the shop, clean and minimalist. The scheme of the store aims to follow a white, tan, and green pattern to resemble natural and freshness. A business model of theirs is that they want to be advertised through word-of-mouth as opposed to the typical ads/commercial method.</li>
                        <br><br></font>
                    <b><font size=4>Getting to Know the Website</b></font>
                    <br><font size=3>Ricky described the goal of their website is to provide their customers with a positive experience and with information about their business, products, and services. What he enjoyed about the original website was the minimalist design and color scheme because it reflected the interior design of the store. However, he felt that the landing screen, photo menu layout, and navigation on the mobile end were not effective. Our client emphasized their need for a <b>photo driven website</b> to communicate the wholesomeness of their brand, and their value in building a friendly community. </li>
                        <br><br></font>
                    <b><font size=4>User Interviews</b></font>
                    <font size=3><br>We needed to hear from actual customers to further understand how to redesign the website to also meet their needs. Our team interviewed 10 customers on site to get to know them and their familiarity with the store and website. We had them navigate through the site as we observed and asked follow up questions.</li>

                    <br><font size=3>After analyzing the responses from user interviews, we created <b>three personas</b> to guide us through our redesign.

                          </div>
                        <br>Next, our team created two scenarios and a list of use cases per persona. Based on information we gathered from our client, user interviews, and personas, we made a <b>features & functionality table</b> to lay out items needed on the website.

                    <br>
                    <b><font size=4>Competitive Analysis</font></b>
                    <br><font size=3>We needed to show our client and also learn for ourselves what their competitors’ websites look like and how features on other websites have been designed. We chose five competitors to analyze: 7 Leaves Cafe, Holy Matcha SD, It’s Boba Time, Kung Fu Tea, and Jin Tea Shop. We specifically compared each competitors <b>brand, website functionality, content, site architecture, and design</b>. Through competitive analysis, we were able to distinguish good features from the bad ones and drew a bottom line.

                    <br><font size=3>My team and I brainstormed our website’s site architecture, design, and content. I created <b>low fidelity wireframes</b> for both the mobile and desktop experience using Balsamiq and InVision while keeping the client and users needs in mind. Explore them below.
                      <br>After receiving feedback, our team realized that the organization of our menu design was a bit clunky. We got wrapped up in trying to make it new and unique, but instead it came across unorganized. For the final design, we kept the layout closer to conventional menu displays for easy parsing.

                    <b>NEXT STEPS</b>
                    <br><font size=3>If I had more time for this project, I would have liked to capture photos that were more fitting for the site because a photo driven website was important for our client and customers we interviewed. It was our hope to create a .gif of tea being steeped to fill the landing screen, however we lacked the resources at the time and wanted to prioritize functionality to meet our deadline.
                          <br><br>The next step I would have taken to improve the design and usability of the website would be to perform <b>user testing</b>. Observing user interactions and receiving feedback from potential users would reveal lots of insight on what could be improved and whether the site is meeting user needs. I would use this data to make reiterations and continue to check in with my client.
