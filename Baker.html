                        <br>
                        <br><font size=3>Baker Elementary School is an urban school located within the Mountain View community on the southside of San Diego. Almost the entire population of students are of minority descent with Hispanic/Latino students making up 85% and African-American students making up 11%. In addition, 62.8% are English Language Learners (ELL). For many years, the school has shown a large achievement gap with over half of the students consistently falling below average on standardized test scores, which has been a common trend for culturally diverse students.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>PROJECT</b> - work with Adele Lawrence’s 3rd grade students at Baker Elementary School as co-designers to improve their classroom experience
                        <br><b>DATE</b> - april 2018 - june 2018
                        <br><b>SKILLS</b> - human-centered design process, stakeholder analysis, needs/capacities assessment, teamwork, project management
                        <br><b>TEAM</b> - team of 9

                        <b>DESIGN PROCESS</b>
                        <br>
                        <br><font size=4><b>User Research</b>
                      </font>
                        <br><font size=3>To tackle the design challenge my team and I were presented with, I began by doing research to learn about the history, background, and context of student achievement and the education experience of low-income students. One thing I learned is that the educational achievement of students nationwide have been assessed through standardized tests that puts culturally diverse students like those at Baker at a disadvantage by imposing a sameness agenda typically tailored for white, middle-class students.
                        <br><br>After analyzing online sources, my team and I each interviewed two stakeholders to gain further insight and shared our findings with one another. By the end of the third week of our project, we were finally able to get in contact with our client. Our community liaison of the team spoke over the phone with Ms. Lawrence to learn about her students and general teaching style. With the information we had from online research, stakeholder interviews, and conversation with Ms. Lawrence, my team and I began defining our problem and users. </br></br>

                        <b><font size=4>User Personas</font></b>
                        <br><font size=3>I created user profiles, empathy maps, and another teammate made journey maps. My team and I had ideas of designing interactive lesson plans since Ms. Lawrence expressed that she liked to emphasize teamwork and that her students enjoy creative art projects, however, there is a lack of that due to time. We translated our user’s needs and other critical objectives and constraints into measurable design requirements.

                        <font size=4><b>Problem Statement</b></font>
                        <br><font size=3>A week after the phone call with Ms. Lawrence, three members on the team visited Baker to make the first round of observations and had short conversations with the students and Ms. Lawrence. We learned that aside from the achievement gap Baker faces, they also have a lack of community engagement from school boards and parents. Ms. Lawrence mentioned that she had already been working with lots of ways to improve the achievement gap and has seen a big improvement in scores from the year before. This led us to pivot our ideas to focus on community engagement, producing our problem statement:
                        <br><br><center><li>Students in Ms. Lawrence’s third grade class, who are predominantly socio-economically disadvantaged Latinx students, need more interactive, engaging activities in their curriculum with a focus on community engagement because this will increase the outside support necessary for the foundation of their education. </li></center>
                      </font>

                        <br><font size=4><b>Concepts</b></font>
                        <br><font size=3>The next step was to generate concepts. We came up with a total of 53 ideas, then individually voted on 5 that we believed were most feasible and would meet our user’s needs. The 3 ideas that had the most votes were a Pen Pal/Buddy System, Fundraiser, and Classroom Newsletter. We evaluated each concept based on our design requirements and weighed out the strengths and weaknesses. I made capture grids of each concept to further flesh out our evaluations

                        <font size=3>Another teammate created a decision matrix to develop a final concept, which was the classroom newsletter. This solution would fulfill a core need of developing the students’ writing and typing skills. As we learned from Ms. Lawrence, school standards expect students to master typing by the 2nd grade. The Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) standardized test is computerized and requires students to type their responses in paragraphs and short answers. Testing didn’t become computerized until a few years ago, and Ms. Lawrence believed that there had been a significant decline in scores since the change. Further, in conversations I had with students, I learned that most lacked access to wifi and technological devices outside of school. My team and I believed that a classroom newsletter would allow students to practice their writing, while simultaneously working on their typing skills. The newsletter would be distributed around school and to parents.

                        <br>
                        <font size=3>The first iteration of our prototype was a worksheet with four questions related to school, dream job, family, and technology. The goal of this prototype was to see the students’ reaction to the questions and how well they were able to respond to them. I and three other team members assisted students with the worksheets and quickly noticed that they had trouble understanding the questions and struggled with spelling and making sentences. Based on feedback we received from Ms. Lawrence, she recommended that we rephrase the questions by creating sentence structures (e.g. My dream job is ___ because ___).
                        <br><br><center><img src="demo-images/BakerUserTesting.png" alt="" /></center></br></br>
                        For our second prototype, we created a Google Form consisting of 4 questions. My teammate and I worked with 5 students each on their classroom laptops. We had the students read the questions aloud and type in their responses. From this prototype, we realized that we overestimated the students’ typing abilities. Each student took a long time typing out their responses and needed assistance with spelling, expressing their thoughts, and even finding letters on the keyboard.

                            To produce a quality newsletter that would meet our project goals and impact the third grade experience in a meaningful way, we would have needed more time to hold computer lab workshops to assist the students. This would not have been feasible within the remaining four weeks that we had.

                            <font size=4><b>Concept Pivot</b></font>
                        <br><font size=3>With the limited time we had, we needed to pivot our solution. In a group meeting, we discussed new ideas that would be more feasible, yet still meet our project goals. We came up with a storyboard book, which would be a bound collection of the students’ storyboard worksheets. The worksheet would essentially be a canvas for the students to draw in response to a prompt (i.e. Draw someone who inspires you and write a sentence about them). We would scan a copy of each worksheet and have the original go to the parents and the copy be bound into the book. The book would be for Ms. Lawrence to keep in the classroom for her current and future students to see. The next class of third graders get to preview the kind of activities to expect and look up to their older peer’s work. Through this book, Ms. Lawrence keeps the connection with her students as they enter the next grade and eventually graduate from Baker Elementary. If students were to visit, they would be able to reflect on the book and continue to feel a sense of community with their school.

                            <font size=3>In this project, I learned the importance of internal and external communication when working with a client on a large cross functional team. I gained practice with applying the human-centered design process on a sustainable community development project. I learned how to write a professional report to document my project work. We wrote a 51 page report and gave two professional presentations on our project’s work in progress and final deliverable.
                        <br><br>The continuation of this project lies in Ms. Lawrence’s hands. My team and I gave her instructions for use if she decides to sustain our project. We envision this project being used routinely 3 times throughout the school year. With regular installations of the storyboard, growth of individual students through a year can be seen. Knowing the success of whether our solution has improved community engagement would take long term tracking, which unfortunately was not in the scope of our project. However, I believe that we brought awareness to this crucial problem and is the right foundation for future students who will work on this project to create sustainable and impactful solutions.
