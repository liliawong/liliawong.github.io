                        Excessive amounts of information/text and a large variety of sections, while perhaps useful in some contexts, can be disorienting and make website navigation difficult. While this is true of human-computer interaction in general, it is particularly relevant to older users who may lack the sort of intuition and constant interaction with technology that younger users have that allows them to filter out unnecessary information or utilize tools to streamline navigation and general usage. Websites with overwhelming amounts of information may be difficult to navigate, so focusing on the most important information and presenting it in a simple and accessible way can be very helpful to enhance satisfaction and successful usage for users above the age of 40. Working with a team of 4, our goal was to create a travel planning website targeted for users ages 40 and over that met this target community’s user needs.
                        <br>
                      <br><b>PROJECT</b> - build a travel web application to serve people age 40 and over

                    <b>DESIGN PROCESS</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <font size=4><b>Interviews/Needfinding</b></font>
                    <font size=3><br>My team and I began by interviewing 3 members from our target community. We gave each interviewee a unique task to perform on a website and asked them to think out loud as they walked us through their task. These tasks were:
                        <br><br>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 100px;" class="design-points">
                          <li>Use the library's computer to find a book's availability and location
                          <li>Purchase clothes for a newborn on Amazon.com
                          <li>Find information about transcripts for transfer students on UCSD's website</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                            During the interviews, I captured images of breakdowns, which are mistakes a user may experience when interacting with a product. These images served as design opportunities that we could look back on when it came to designing and building our app. Through our observations and findings, we generated a list of 15 specific user needs.
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img src="demo-images/DuckTravelBreakdown.jpg" alt="" />
                            <br><font size=2>An interviewee entered his search with a typo, which resulted in "no entries found". There was no autocorrect/search suggestions. Instead, he had to copy and paste his search into Google to find the book he was looking for.
                            </center></font>
                    </font>
                    <br>
                    <font size=4><b>Prototypes</b></font>
                    <br><font size=3>To help us brainstorm over the kind of website we were going to build, we needed to visualize specific use cases where an application would be desirable. I sketched two of three storyboards that illustrated a specific user need (shown below). Next, we created 2 paper prototypes that instantiated two of our storyboards. We chose to create the navigation app and the travel planning app. Each paper prototype showed all essential elements of a user interface. Further, our group performed heuristic evaluations on our peers' paper prototypes. I used Nielsen’s ten heuristics and severity ratings for usability problems to evaluate their work. Giving and receiving feedback was helpful for us to understand where improvements needed to be made.
                          <br><br><center><img src="demo-images/DuckTravelStoryboards.jpg" alt="" />
                            <br><font size=2>Storyboards illustrating specific user needs from our target community
                            </center></font>
                    <br>As this point, our team decided to choose our travel planning idea as the application we were going to build. Our team created a video prototype that showed when a user would use our app and the core features it would have. I edited the video and helped with filming.

                    <font size=4><b>Wireframes</b></font>
                    <br><font size=3>Using Balsamiq Mockups, I created low-fidelity wireframes for two screens of our app: the search results page and the city descriptions page. The purpose of these wireframes was to lay out core functionality and to show how I expect users to interact with the app.

                    <br>
                    <font size=4><b>User Testing & Redesign</b></font>
                    <br><font size=3>When implementing, we decided to transition our application solely into a website because we felt that travel planning is usually done on a computer. We created our website to be optimized on a 13 inch MacBook Air on desktop view. After our group finished the core implementations of our website, I created a protocol for us to use during user testing. I facilitated our user tests by informing our users of how the test will run, gave them a task to do on our site, and debriefed them. From the findings in our user tests, we made some redesigns on the site such as including a “show more” and “show less” button on the food and landmark description. This was to resolve the issue of overwhelming our users with huge chunks of text.
                            <br><br><center><img src="demo-images/DuckTravelShowMoreLess.png" alt="" /></center>
                        <br>
                        <font size=4><b>A/B Testing</b></font>
                    <br><font size=3>We set up our A/B test with Google Analytics and tested 49 users. Our A/B test aimed to measure whether or not having a hover effect over the popular destinations on the homepage would have an impact on whether or not users would click on them. The homepage version with the hover effect had a box that popped up over the image with the city’s name, a short description, and a “Learn More” button. Results showed that having a hover effect led to more clicks, thus we kept the hover effect for our final website.</br>

                    <b>FINAL DESIGN</b>
                    <br>
                    <br><font size=3>Overall, our final product involves features that keep in mind the user needs we discovered in the beginning of our process. We kept each page uncluttered and displayed the most important information a user would need to plan a trip to a country. Users can search for a country, which will display popular cities in that country. Each city’s page lists notable dishes as well as important landmarks. For each local specialty, users can expand the description for more detailed information. If they want to travel to that city, they can press the add to cart button to add it to their travel planner. All of these functionalities contribute to our app’s point of view, which is to simplify and organize information so users can quickly and easily navigate our website and make travel plans. Our users need to have a comprehensive travel planning service that includes the ability to search, learn, and plan trip details for a certain location. Our travel planner page lists the cities we’ve added so far. Users can rearrange or remove these cities as well as go back to add new cities to the planner. After setting the dates for the trip that’s been planned, they can press the “plan trip now” button to access our trip plan, which shows our destinations as well as the food to try and places to visit for each destination.

                    <br>
                    <br><font size=3>The main thing that I learned is the importance of understanding who you are designing for. The process of interviewing and needfinding is critical for laying down the foundation of your project. If I had more time, I would have liked to spend more time on this stage of the design process. I would interview more users from our target community and dig deeper into needfinding.
                          <br><br>Overall, I feel that my team did a great job given the time we had. It was our first time getting hands-on practice with a human-centered design process while building a web application. Although the website has lots of room for improvement, I'm very happy with how it turned out as we kept our users in mind and remained process-oriented.
